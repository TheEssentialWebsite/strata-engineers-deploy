      <p>At Strata Consulting Engineers, we provide specialized foundation evaluation and geotechnical consulting services designed to help property owners, developers, and contractors make informed decisions about their projects. Our comprehensive approach combines decades of experience with practical, cost-effective solutions.</p>
      
      <h2>Foundation Evaluations</h2>
      <h3>Comprehensive visual assessment of existing residential and commercial foundations</h3>
      <p>Our detailed foundation evaluations identify settlement issues, foundation concerns, and recommend cost-effective solutions. Each evaluation includes visual inspection, measurement of movement, crack pattern analysis, and customized recommendations for existing foundations.</p>
      
      <h2>Geotechnical Consultations</h2>
      <h3>Expert analysis of soil conditions and their impact on existing structures</h3>
      <p>We provide comprehensive soil condition reviews and interpretations of geotechnical reports to identify potential foundation risks. Our analysis helps property owners and developers understand how local soil conditions affect foundation stability and longevity.</p>
      
      <h2>Project Reviews</h2>
      <h3>Professional evaluation of engineering reports and project documentation</h3>
      <p>Our expert review services analyze existing engineering documentation, foundation reports, and project specifications to validate findings, identify concerns, and ensure regulatory compliance before proceeding with your project.</p>
      
      <h2>On-Site Consultations</h2>

      <h2>Concrete NDT Assessment</h2>
      <h3>Non-destructive testing for existing concrete integrity and strength</h3>
      <p>Using advanced equipment including Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) testing, rebound hammer analysis, and reinforcement locators, we evaluate existing concrete structures without causing damage. These assessments provide critical data on foundation integrity and durability.</p>
      
      <h2>Foundation Repair Consultations</h2>
      <h3>Independent evaluation of repair options and contractor proposals</h3>
      <p>Our unbiased assessments help property owners understand repair proposals, evaluate contractor recommendations, and select the most appropriate and cost-effective foundation repair solutions for their specific existing foundation situation.</p>
      
      <h2>Expert Witness Services</h2>
      <h3>Professional testimony and consultation for construction-related disputes</h3>
      <p>Drawing on decades of geotechnical engineering experience, Paul G. Carter provides expert witness services for legal proceedings related to foundation issues, construction defects, and other geotechnical engineering matters with clear, authoritative testimony and documentation.</p>
