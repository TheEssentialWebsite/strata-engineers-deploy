  "articleBody": "## Who Is Strata Consulting Engineers? Meet the Expertise Behind the Name\nStrata Consulting Engineers isn’t your typical engineering firm. Led by Paul G. Carter, Professional Engineer (Civil and Geotechnical), Strata combines decades of deep technical expertise with hands-on experience in the field. This rare blend of knowledge and practicality allows Strata to provide highly reliable, real-world solutions for property owners, engineers, builders, and real estate professionals alike.\nPaul Carter is a licensed civil and geotechnical engineer with over 35 years of experience. What sets him apart? Alongside his engineering credentials, Paul also spent more than two decades as a foundation repair contractor. \nHe’s evaluated thousands of structures, directed teams on complex job sites, and trained professionals across the country in the use of concrete testing equipment. His background includes work across California, Utah, and Nevada on everything from residential tracts and hillside foundations to commercial pads and roadways. When Paul walks onto a job site or reviews a report, he brings both perspectives to the table: that of a seasoned engineer and a contractor who knows how things actually get built, rebuilt, or added onto.\n## Here’s how Strata can help:\n### Foundation Assessment & Evaluation\nFoundation issues can be scary, especially when you’re buying or selling a property. Strata provides unbiased, engineering-driven assessments that help clarify what’s really going on beneath your feet. Whether it's structural cracks, settlement, or water intrusion, Paul and the team identify root causes and recommend appropriate solutions without pushing unnecessary repairs.\nWith experience overseeing thousands of repair projects, Paul knows how to distinguish between superficial signs of age and serious structural problems. His assessments often save clients from spending thousands on unnecessary work or alert them early to issues that could develop into costly repairs.\nThis is especially valuable for homeowners, realtors, and inspectors who need a trusted, third-party opinion before making big decisions.\n[Learn more about our foundation evaluation services](https://strataengineers.com/expertise)\n### Geotechnical Consulting\nSoil matters more than most people realize. Paul’s background includes leading geotechnical investigations on hundreds of residential and commercial sites, performing percolation testing for septic systems, analyzing slope stability for hillside developments, and preparing recommendations to mitigate liquefaction risks in seismically active zones. His work with Mid-Coast Geotechnical in California gave him hands-on experience managing teams, overseeing lab and field testing, and compiling results into practical, code-compliant recommendations. Whether it's a single-family home or commercial, new construction, repair, or expansion, Paul can incorporate his experience to help you understand your geotechnical/foundation engineering reports before you proceed.\n### Concrete Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)\nSometimes you need to know what’s inside the concrete without tearing it apart. That’s where NDT comes in. Using industry-leading tools and methods, Strata can evaluate the strength, consistency, and embedded features of existing concrete structures. This is crucial in old or new concrete, for retrofits, additions, or inspections to avoid damaging the existing concrete.\nPaul’s NDT expertise isn’t just academic; he ran SDS Non-Destructive Testing Equipment, a company that sold, trained, and demoed NDT tools across the country. That hands-on knowledge means he knows the difference between a clean scan and a misleading one. He understands the limitations and strengths of each tool, ensuring that his interpretations lead to clear, confident decisions.\nStrata’s NDT services are especially useful for engineers, contractors, and inspectors who don’t have access to NDT equipment.\n[Explore our NDT services](https://example.com)\n### Professional Education & Consulting\nStrata also supports the engineering and real estate community through professional continuing education (CE) classes. Paul can provide CE seminars tailored for realtors, engineers, and inspectors on a variety of topics, such as; “Signs of Foundation Failure”, “Site Preparation and Grading”, “Non-Distructine Testing of Concrete”, etc.\nPaul has led technical trainings on concrete testing methods, spoken at industry events, provided expert witness testimony, and regularly consults with property managers and engineers on challenging foundation and soil conditions. His virtual consultation service also allows homeowners and remote clients to receive expert insight without the need for an on-site visit.\nWhether it’s a pre-purchase concern, a failed inspection, or a plan review, Paul’s clear communication style and decades of field-tested wisdom can help untangle the issue.\n## Why Strata? Trust Built on Engineering and Experience\nStrata Consulting Engineers exists to provide trusted answers, not to sell you on a fix. If you’re looking for an experienced, credentialed voice that combines engineering knowledge with real-world insight, you’ve come to the right place.\n[View all our services](https://strataengineers.com/expertise) | [Contact us to schedule a consultation](https://strataengineers.com/contact)",
