You glance at the siding near the front porch and notice a thin crack you swear wasn’t there last month. It’s not just a cosmetic blemish. It might be your foundation whispering that something is shifting beneath your feet. Exterior walls carry the heavy burden of your home’s weight, especially in structures where multiple floors and roof trusses push those loads out to the edges. While interior cracks might be unsettling, exterior cracks often point to deeper movement in the foundation itself. And when a crack is wider at one end than the other, that’s a story worth listening to.\n\n## Recognizing the Warning Signs\n\n**What to Look For:**\n\n- Hairline cracks that seem harmless but stretch a little further each season\n\n- Tapered cracks narrow on one end, gaping on the other\n\n- Out of square door and window frames (the “reveal” or gap at the top of the frame changes from one side to the other)\n\n- Siding boards pulling apart or brick mortar joints opening up\n\n![Cracks in exterior of homes](https://exgsbnnyjkjmmxnofnmr.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/uploads/1758050712483-Exterior-Cracks-2.jpg)\n\n## How Cracks Appear in Different Materials\n\n- **Brick:** Stair-step patterns zig-zagging through mortar, or bricks nudged out of place\n\n- **Stucco:** Long vertical or diagonal cracks, or, though less concerning - fine or web-like cracks\n\n- **Siding:** Bowed, warped, or split boards\n\n- **Concrete:** Vertical, diagonal, or horizontal gap in walls or slabs greater than 1/10th Inch wide and growing larger over time\n\nEven small changes like these can be the first signs of shifting soil or settling foundations. Left unchecked, today’s hairline crack can become tomorrow’s major repair impacting doors, windows, and the overall stability of the structure.\n\n## Common Causes of Exterior Cracks\n\nFrom the ground up, a home reacts to its environment. Common culprits include:\n\n- Soil Movement: Expansive clays that swell or loosely compacted soils that consolidate\n- Poor Drainage: Water pooling against the foundation instead of flowing away\n- Tree Roots: Seeking moisture and shifting the ground in the process\n- Design Limitations: Foundations built without considering specific soil conditions\n- Seismic or Vibration Impact: Tremors from earthquakes, traffic, or nearby construction\n- Improper site preparation: Cut/Fill lots with foundations on different soil materials or low compaction effort\n\n## Types of Cracks and Their Implications\n\n- **Hairline Shrinkage Cracks:** Thin, almost pencil-line fractures that run randomly (but particularly diagonal) across the surface. They may appear shortly after construction as the material cures, and may be related to shrinkage of the building material but should be monitored for any widening over time.\n- **Settlement Cracks:** Often starting near corners of window and/or door frames and angling diagonally from the corner, these cracks tend to widen toward one end, hinting at one section of the foundation settling more than the other.\n- **Horizontal Cracks:** Long, straight cracks, typically mid-wall in basements or retaining walls, caused by soil pushing against the wall. They may be accompanied by slight inward bowing of the wall and diagonal cracks at the ends as the wall approaches a perpendicular wall. Alternatively, horizontal cracks just above the soil line on the foundation stem are often a result of rebar corrosion and may need to be evaluated.\n- **Step Cracks in Brick or Block:** Zig-zag patterns following mortar joints, resembling a staircase. These often show up in masonry where the foundation is experiencing differential movement.\n\n## Role of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) \n\nAdding to the Story: Ultrasonic testing, rebar locators, rebound hammers and other NDT tools allow us to add depth to the stories without tearing open the structure. NDT can confirm the presence and placement of reinforcing steel, identify voids or honeycombing in concrete, and detect subtle changes in density and strength that may indicate the current integrity of the structure.\n\n## Contact Strata Consulting Engineers\n\nAt Strata Consulting Engineers, we combine decades of engineering know-how with the practical sense that comes from years in the field. If you’ve spotted a crack or just have a feeling something’s not right let’s talk. We offer in-person and virtual consultations to fit your needs.\n\n**Contact us today to schedule your foundation evaluation:** [StrataEngineers.com](https://strataengineers.com/contact) | Office: 435-216-1221 | contact@strataengineers.com\n",

<p>Imagine walking around your home after a rainstorm. You glance at the siding near the front porch and notice a thin crack you swear wasn’t there last month. It’s not just a cosmetic blemish. It might be your foundation whispering that something is shifting beneath your feet. Exterior walls carry the heavy burden of your home’s weight, especially in structures where multiple floors and roof trusses push those loads out to the edges. While interior cracks might be unsettling, exterior cracks often point to deeper movement in the foundation itself. And when a crack is wider at one end than the other, that’s a story worth listening to.</p>
<h2 id="recognizing-the-warning-signs">Recognizing the Warning Signs</h2>
<p><strong>What to Look For:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hairline cracks that seem harmless but stretch a little further each season</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tapered cracks narrow on one end, gaping on the other</p>
</li>
<li><p>Out of square door and window frames (the “reveal” or gap at the top of the frame changes from one side to the other)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Siding boards pulling apart or brick mortar joints opening up</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-cracks-appear-in-different-materials">How Cracks Appear in Different Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brick:</strong> Stair-step patterns zig-zagging through mortar, or bricks nudged out of place</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stucco:</strong> Long vertical or diagonal cracks, or, though less concerning - fine or web-like cracks</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Siding:</strong> Bowed, warped, or split boards</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Concrete:</strong> Vertical, diagonal, or horizontal gap in walls or slabs greater than 1/10th Inch wide and growing larger over time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even small changes like these can be the first signs of shifting soil or settling foundations. Left unchecked, today’s hairline crack can become tomorrow’s major repair impacting doors, windows, and the overall stability of the structure.</p>
<h2 id="common-causes-of-exterior-cracks">Common Causes of Exterior Cracks</h2>
<p>From the ground up, a home reacts to its environment. Common culprits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil Movement: Expansive clays that swell or loosely compacted soils that consolidate</li>
<li>Poor Drainage: Water pooling against the foundation instead of flowing away</li>
<li>Tree Roots: Seeking moisture and shifting the ground in the process</li>
<li>Design Limitations: Foundations built without considering specific soil conditions</li>
<li>Seismic or Vibration Impact: Tremors from earthquakes, traffic, or nearby construction</li>
<li>Improper site preparation: Cut/Fill lots with foundations on different soil materials or low compaction effort</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-cracks-and-their-implications">Types of Cracks and Their Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hairline Shrinkage Cracks:</strong> Thin, almost pencil-line fractures that run randomly (but particularly diagonal) across the surface. They may appear shortly after construction as the material cures, and may be related to shrinkage of the building material but should be monitored for any widening over time.</li>
<li><strong>Settlement Cracks:</strong> Often starting near corners of window and/or door frames and angling diagonally from the corner, these cracks tend to widen toward one end, hinting at one section of the foundation settling more than the other.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Cracks:</strong> Long, straight cracks, typically mid-wall in basements or retaining walls, caused by soil pushing against the wall. They may be accompanied by slight inward bowing of the wall and diagonal cracks at the ends as the wall approaches a perpendicular wall. Alternatively, horizontal cracks just above the soil line on the foundation stem are often a result of rebar corrosion and may need to be evaluated.</li>
<li><strong>Step Cracks in Brick or Block:</strong> Zig-zag patterns following mortar joints, resembling a staircase. These often show up in masonry where the foundation is experiencing differential movement.</li>
