  "articleBody": "Foundation issues rarely appear overnight. Most of the time, the signs start small. A crack here. A sticky door there. Easy to dismiss in the moment, but over time, these little indicators can grow into larger, more expensive structural problems.\n\nOne of the most common causes of foundation distress is what's called differential settlement. In engineering terms, we typically define this as a slope of more than 1/4 inch drop over 20 feet. That might not sound like much, but it can be enough to start causing visible issues throughout a structure.\n\nOf course, not all cracks or quirks are structural red flags. But when movement does occur, it often shows up in very predictable ways. And if you know what to look for, you can catch these problems early—before they start affecting the long-term performance of the structure.\n\n## Common Signs of Foundation Movement\n\nSome of the most consistent indicators we see in the field include:\n\n- **Cracks that continue to widen:** Key indications of active movement are cracks that continue to open.  A common sign is a new crack in the drywall patch of an old crack.\n\n- **Cracks near windows and door frames:** These often start small but widen over time, especially in drywall or stucco.\n\n- **Cracks in foundation stems and slabs:** Visible at patios or above grade often show shrinkage or temperature-related cracks. But if you see a series of cracks, raised joints, sloping, or partial-circle patterns, it’s time for a closer look.\n\n- **Sticking or misaligned doors and windows:** If they stop latching or appear out of square, the foundation may be shifting.\n\n- **Sloping or uneven floors:** In both raised wood and slab-on-grade homes, floor slopes can indicate differential settlement and possibly plumbing leaks under the floors.\n\n- **Separation between walls and ceilings or floors:** When walls pull away, it's often a symptom of structural movement.\n\nIt’s important to remember that different materials respond differently to stress. For example, masonry and drywall are brittle and show cracks early, while flexible finishes like vinyl siding or elastomeric stucco may hide early signs of movement.\n\n## Why It Matters Early On\n\nAgain, all cracks observed in the house aren't necessarily related to foundation movement.  If, however, two or more of these signs show up in the same area of the structure, the likelihood of foundation movement being the cause increases significantly. Foundation movement, left unchecked, may start as a cosmetic concern but, if movement continues, can turn into structural instability quickly. That means:\n\n- Increased repair costs down the line\n- Decreased property value\n- Complications during resale or remodeling\n- Water intrusion issues into basements or crawl spaces\n\n## What Happens If You Ignore It?\n\nIgnoring the early signs of foundation movement can set the stage for a series of escalating issues:\n\n- **Structural Damage Worsens:** What starts as a hairline crack can become a major split, resulting in an alert mark by a home inspector, impacting load-bearing elements and the overall integrity of the structure.\n\n- **Mechanical Systems Get Affected:** Plumbing lines, HVAC ducts, and electrical conduits can shift or break as the structure moves, leading to leaks, short circuits, and other costly repairs.\n\n- **Doors and Windows May Fail:** Over time, shifting frames can jam shut, or open, or leave gaps that let in pests, drafts, and moisture.\n\n- **Moisture Intrusion Increases:** As cracks expand and joints separate, water finds easier paths into the building.  In homes with a crawlspace or basement, this can lead to mold, rot, and moisture damage to floors and walls.\n\nThe bottom line? A wait-and-see approach might seem like the easy option, but it often leads to bigger repairs, more disruption, and less flexibility in solutions.\n\n## Questions Worth Asking\n\nWhether you’re considering a property, reviewing inspection reports, or overseeing construction, it helps to think like an engineer. A few smart questions go a long way:\n\n- Are the cracks enlarging in length and width over time (cracked patches)?\n- Is there a measurable slope or sag across the floor?\n- Have the door and window frames shifted noticeably?\n- Has drainage changed recently near the structure (new landscaping)?\n- Is there a history of soil movement in this area (sags in streets and sidewalks)?\n\nThese aren’t just checklist items. They’re conversation starters—the kind of things we often ask when we’re called out to evaluate a site.\n\n## When to Call for a Foundation Evaluation\n\nYou don’t need to wait until you see major signs of movement to get an engineering opinion. In fact, it’s better if you don’t. A qualified engineering evaluation can help determine:\n\n- Whether the signs are cosmetic or structural\n- What kind of movement (if any) is occurring\n- Whether you need further geotechnical insight\n- What options are available to stabilize or repair the issue and the possible cost\n\nIf you’re seeing cracks, slopes, or signs that just don’t sit right, we’re happy to help. We bring decades of combined engineering and foundation repair experience to every evaluation. Whether you’re dealing with obvious structural movement or just want a second opinion, we can take a look, explain what’s happening, and talk through your options.\n\n[Schedule a Consultation](https://strataengineers.com/contact) to take the next step. Let’s get eyes on the problem before it becomes something bigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

<li><p><strong>Cracks in foundation stems and slabs:</strong> Visible at patios or above grade often show shrinkage or temperature-related cracks. But if you see a series of cracks, raised joints, sloping, or partial-circle patterns, it’s time for a closer look.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sticking or misaligned doors and windows:</strong> If they stop latching or appear out of square, the foundation may be shifting.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sloping or uneven floors:</strong> In both raised wood and slab-on-grade homes, floor slopes can indicate differential settlement and possibly plumbing leaks under the floors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Separation between walls and ceilings or floors:</strong> When walls pull away, it&#39;s often a symptom of structural movement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to remember that different materials respond differently to stress. For example, masonry and drywall are brittle and show cracks early, while flexible finishes like vinyl siding or elastomeric stucco may hide early signs of movement.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters-early-on">Why It Matters Early On</h2>
<p>Again, all cracks observed in the house aren&#39;t necessarily related to foundation movement.  If, however, two or more of these signs show up in the same area of the structure, the likelihood of foundation movement being the cause increases significantly. Foundation movement, left unchecked, may start as a cosmetic concern but, if movement continues, can turn into structural instability quickly. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased repair costs down the line</li>
<li>Decreased property value</li>
<li>Complications during resale or remodeling</li>
<li>Water intrusion issues into basements or crawl spaces</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Happens If You Ignore It?</h2>
<p>Ignoring the early signs of foundation movement can set the stage for a series of escalating issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Structural Damage Worsens:</strong> What starts as a hairline crack can become a major split, resulting in an alert mark by a home inspector, impacting load-bearing elements and the overall integrity of the structure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanical Systems Get Affected:</strong> Plumbing lines, HVAC ducts, and electrical conduits can shift or break as the structure moves, leading to leaks, short circuits, and other costly repairs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Doors and Windows May Fail:</strong> Over time, shifting frames can jam shut, or open, or leave gaps that let in pests, drafts, and moisture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Moisture Intrusion Increases:</strong> As cracks expand and joints separate, water finds easier paths into the building.  In homes with a crawlspace or basement, this can lead to mold, rot, and moisture damage to floors and walls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line? A wait-and-see approach might seem like the easy option, but it often leads to bigger repairs, more disruption, and less flexibility in solutions.</p>
<h2 id="questions-worth-asking">Questions Worth Asking</h2>
<p>Whether you’re considering a property, reviewing inspection reports, or overseeing construction, it helps to think like an engineer. A few smart questions go a long way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the cracks enlarging in length and width over time (cracked patches)?</li>
<li>Is there a measurable slope or sag across the floor?</li>
<li>Have the door and window frames shifted noticeably?</li>
<li>Has drainage changed recently near the structure (new landscaping)?</li>
<li>Is there a history of soil movement in this area (sags in streets and sidewalks)?</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren’t just checklist items. They’re conversation starters—the kind of things we often ask when we’re called out to evaluate a site.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-call-for-a-foundation-evaluation">When to Call for a Foundation Evaluation</h2>
<p>You don’t need to wait until you see major signs of movement to get an engineering opinion. In fact, it’s better if you don’t. A qualified engineering evaluation can help determine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the signs are cosmetic or structural</li>
<li>What kind of movement (if any) is occurring</li>
<li>Whether you need further geotechnical insight</li>
<li>What options are available to stabilize or repair the issue and the possible cost</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re seeing cracks, slopes, or signs that just don’t sit right, we’re happy to help. We bring decades of combined engineering and foundation repair experience to every evaluation. Whether you’re dealing with obvious structural movement or just want a second opinion, we can take a look, explain what’s happening, and talk through your options.</p>
