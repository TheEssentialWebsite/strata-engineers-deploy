  "articleBody": "## A Hidden Risk to Your Foundation\n\nIn southern Utah, it’s easy to assume we don’t get enough rain to worry about drainage. But all it takes is one intense summer thunderstorm to send water rushing where it shouldn’t go. At Strata Consulting Engineers, we’ve seen firsthand how poor drainage—even in desert environments—can quietly lead to serious foundation damage.\n\nHere’s why drainage still matters in dry climates, and what different professionals should know to protect properties and prevent long-term issues.\n\n## For Homeowners: What You Can't See Can Hurt Your Home\n\nMany homes in southern Utah were built without gutters; pads can refer to a flat area of ground wher construction will take place OR the slab of an existing building. in this case it may be more appropriate to say \"or on building pads that don’t direct water away from the structure. After a rainstorm, water often ponds next to the foundation—especially on poorly graded lots. Over time, that moisture can lead to:\n\n- **Expansive soil movement**: Many local soils are clay-rich, expanding when wet and shrinking when dry. This cycle—even if triggered only once or twice a year—can cause stress on the foundation, leading to uneven support.\n\n- **Foundation heave or settlement**: Saturating the soil beneath one section of a foundation can cause part of it to lift or sink while the rest stays stable. This differential movement results in misalignment, structural strain, and costly repairs.\n\n- **Cracks in walls and floors**: When the foundation shifts, it often transfers stress into the structure. Look for diagonal cracks at window and door frames, gaps opening in tile and flooring or other signs of structural movement. These signs can also occur in raised floor (crawlspace) construction.\n\n- **Moisture intrusion and mold**: Standing water near a foundation can seep into crawlspaces or through concrete walls. Even if the surface dries quickly, moisture trapped below can lead to mold, building material damage, and unhealthy indoor air.\n\nThe real culprit isn’t the volume of rain—it’s how poorly the site handles that rain when it comes. Because damage may unfold slowly, many homeowners don’t notice until significant repairs are needed. That’s why a consulting engineer evaluation—especially one familiar with soil behavior—is worth the investment.\n\n## What to Ask Your Realtor About Drainage Before You Buy\n\nIn dry regions like southern Utah, it’s easy to assume drainage isn’t a big deal. But that assumption can be costly. Even one summer thunderstorm can send water racing across a poorly graded lot—and if that water ends up near the foundation, it can lead to real problems.\n\nAs a buyer, here are a few things to bring up with your realtor:\n\n- Have there been signs of water damage or pooling near the foundation?\n- Are there visible cracks in walls, floors, or masonry?\n- Do doors or windows stick in a way that might suggest movement?\n- Are there musty odors or visible water stains in the crawlspace or basement?\n\nAsk whether a previous evaluation has been done—and if not, consider requesting one. An engineering consultation before purchase can help you understand any red flags, avoid future repair costs, and negotiate with confidence.\nDon’t wait until after closing to find out the site wasn’t draining properly. A few smart questions now can prevent major headaches later.\n\n## What to Talk About with Your Engineer: Drainage by Design\n\nEven in desert regions, drainage isn’t something to overlook. Your engineer should walk you through why a site’s grading, soil behavior, and elevation all matter when periodic heavy storm hits.\n\nHere are a few key items to ask about:\n\n- Is the pad elevated enough to shed water away from the foundation?\n- Has surface drainage been accounted for in the site plan?\n- What are the risks tied to the local soil type, such as expansion or collapse?\n\nYou’ll also want to ask how they plan to mitigate those risks. That might include:\n\n- Slightly raising the building pad for better runoff\n- Adding swales, French drains, or other features to manage surface water\n- Selecting a foundation system that handles moisture fluctuation\n- Thinking beyond code minimums to reflect real-world site behavior alert landscapers to avoid final grading, planters, and pavement that may create ponds or direct water flow towards the foundation\n\nBringing these questions up early in the design process can help prevent major repair costs and foundation problems down the road.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**How much rain does it take to cause damage?**\n Sometimes less than an inch of rain in an hour can overwhelm poorly graded properties. Compact desert soils don’t absorb water quickly, so runoff often ponds near the foundation.\n\n**Why would my home have problems now if it’s been fine for years?**\n Soil-related issues can develop gradually -- particularly if the landscaping is changed or the mature landscape creates dams or changes the slope. One heavy storm can tip the balance—especially if your site lacked drainage planning from the start.\n\n**Do gutters really help in dry climates?**\n Absolutely. Gutters and downspouts are the first line of defense, directing water away before it ever reaches your foundation.\n\n**Should I hire an engineer or a contractor?**\n Contractors can perform the work but may not understand the big picture . If you would like to understand subsurface soil behavior or get a neutral, expert opinion, consult a licensed engineer.\n\n**When should I call for an evaluation?**\n If you notice new cracks, water near the foundation, or signs of movement—or if you're buying or building—it’s a smart time to schedule a consultation.\n\n## Get Expert Eyes on Your Site\n\nAt Strata Consulting Engineers, we specialize in evaluating soil-related foundation problems in dry, unpredictable climates. Paul G. Carter, P.E., G.E., brings over 35 years of engineering and field experience to every consultation.\n\n[If you’re seeing signs of movement or just want peace of mind let’s talk.](https://strataengineers.com/contact) We’ll help you understand what’s happening, what’s at risk, and how to fix or avoid it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

<p>In southern Utah, it’s easy to assume we don’t get enough rain to worry about drainage. But all it takes is one intense summer thunderstorm to send water rushing where it shouldn’t go. At Strata Consulting Engineers, we’ve seen firsthand how poor drainage—even in desert environments—can quietly lead to serious foundation damage.</p>
<p>Here’s why drainage still matters in dry climates, and what different professionals should know to protect properties and prevent long-term issues.</p>
<h2>For Homeowners: What You Can&#39;t See Can Hurt Your Home</h2>
<p>Many homes in southern Utah were built without gutters; pads can refer to a flat area of ground wher construction will take place OR the slab of an existing building. in this case it may be more appropriate to say &quot;or on building pads that don’t direct water away from the structure. After a rainstorm, water often ponds next to the foundation—especially on poorly graded lots. Over time, that moisture can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Expansive soil movement</strong>: Many local soils are clay-rich, expanding when wet and shrinking when dry. This cycle—even if triggered only once or twice a year—can cause stress on the foundation, leading to uneven support.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Foundation heave or settlement</strong>: Saturating the soil beneath one section of a foundation can cause part of it to lift or sink while the rest stays stable. This differential movement results in misalignment, structural strain, and costly repairs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cracks in walls and floors</strong>: When the foundation shifts, it often transfers stress into the structure. Look for diagonal cracks at window and door frames, gaps opening in tile and flooring or other signs of structural movement. These signs can also occur in raised floor (crawlspace) construction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Moisture intrusion and mold</strong>: Standing water near a foundation can seep into crawlspaces or through concrete walls. Even if the surface dries quickly, moisture trapped below can lead to mold, building material damage, and unhealthy indoor air.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The real culprit isn’t the volume of rain—it’s how poorly the site handles that rain when it comes. Because damage may unfold slowly, many homeowners don’t notice until significant repairs are needed. That’s why a consulting engineer evaluation—especially one familiar with soil behavior—is worth the investment.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-ask-your-realtor-about-drainage-before-you-buy">What to Ask Your Realtor About Drainage Before You Buy</h2>
<p>In dry regions like southern Utah, it’s easy to assume drainage isn’t a big deal. But that assumption can be costly. Even one summer thunderstorm can send water racing across a poorly graded lot—and if that water ends up near the foundation, it can lead to real problems.</p>
<p>As a buyer, here are a few things to bring up with your realtor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have there been signs of water damage or pooling near the foundation?</li>
<li>Are there visible cracks in walls, floors, or masonry?</li>
<li>Do doors or windows stick in a way that might suggest movement?</li>
<li>Are there musty odors or visible water stains in the crawlspace or basement?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask whether a previous evaluation has been done—and if not, consider requesting one. An engineering consultation before purchase can help you understand any red flags, avoid future repair costs, and negotiate with confidence.
Don’t wait until after closing to find out the site wasn’t draining properly. A few smart questions now can prevent major headaches later.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-talk-about-with-your-engineer-drainage-by-design">What to Talk About with Your Engineer: Drainage by Design</h2>
<p>Even in desert regions, drainage isn’t something to overlook. Your engineer should walk you through why a site’s grading, soil behavior, and elevation all matter when periodic heavy storm hits.</p>
<p>Here are a few key items to ask about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the pad elevated enough to shed water away from the foundation?</li>
<li>Has surface drainage been accounted for in the site plan?</li>
<li>What are the risks tied to the local soil type, such as expansion or collapse?</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also want to ask how they plan to mitigate those risks. That might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly raising the building pad for better runoff</li>
<li>Adding swales, French drains, or other features to manage surface water</li>
<li>Selecting a foundation system that handles moisture fluctuation</li>
<li>Thinking beyond code minimums to reflect real-world site behavior alert landscapers to avoid final grading, planters, and pavement that may create ponds or direct water flow towards the foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>Bringing these questions up early in the design process can help prevent major repair costs and foundation problems down the road.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>How much rain does it take to cause damage?</strong>
 Sometimes less than an inch of rain in an hour can overwhelm poorly graded properties. Compact desert soils don’t absorb water quickly, so runoff often ponds near the foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Why would my home have problems now if it’s been fine for years?</strong>
 Soil-related issues can develop gradually -- particularly if the landscaping is changed or the mature landscape creates dams or changes the slope. One heavy storm can tip the balance—especially if your site lacked drainage planning from the start.</p>
<p><strong>Do gutters really help in dry climates?</strong>
 Absolutely. Gutters and downspouts are the first line of defense, directing water away before it ever reaches your foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Should I hire an engineer or a contractor?</strong>
 Contractors can perform the work but may not understand the big picture . If you would like to understand subsurface soil behavior or get a neutral, expert opinion, consult a licensed engineer.</p>
<p><strong>When should I call for an evaluation?</strong>
 If you notice new cracks, water near the foundation, or signs of movement—or if you&#39;re buying or building—it’s a smart time to schedule a consultation.</p>
